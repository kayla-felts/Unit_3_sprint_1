- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

        In my opinion an important part of code reviews is providing quality
        feedback about excessive code. I greatly appreciate when people also 
        let me knwo how I can cutdown on the amount of code I have to write
        to do something and make my code more readable.

- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

        Containers help us improve functionality of code on across multiple 
        computers by creating an image that contains all the dependencies and 
        packages that we will need to run the code. So that when someone downloads 
        and tries to run our code, it will work on thier machince just as well as 
        on our own machine without having to download every package individually.
